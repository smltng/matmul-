Summary
-------
Wow, you guys tried a lot. The change in the loop ordering was a good choice. By any chance, did you try the other combinations of orderings (e.g. jik, kji, etc.)? 

Also, good catch with the conflict misses, and very clever way of handling it. 

In the hierarchical blocking section, another group got a different number for the L1 cache than your group did. Is it 32 or 64?
